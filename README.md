This program is a simulation of the well known game Rock-Paper-Scissors. It implements the following functional 
requirements:

- One player should always play randomly, the other should always choose rock.
- The application should play 100 rounds of the game
- The application should evaluate the game logic, i.e. the result (e.g. WIN, DRAW, LOSE) of two actions (e.g. ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR) competing against each other
- The application should calculate at least the number of wins for each player and the number of draws.
